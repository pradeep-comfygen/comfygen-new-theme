                    The React Native framework is free and open-source. The
                    development of your idea will require the assistance of a
                    team of experts. It is possible to accomplish this by
                    building up your own team or outsourcing your entire
                    project.

                    If you are looking to implement a number of features in your
                    project, you will have to invest a certain amount of money
                    in a team. The hourly rate of the software developers you
                    want will determine your level of investment.

                    Depending on your project, you may have to build and develop
                    with React Native. As a result, the costs may be similar to
                    those associated with software development.
