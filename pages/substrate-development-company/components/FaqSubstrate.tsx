    li3: "Substrate Core: The core is responsible for ensuring that the runtime implementation is done the right way by targeting the WebAssembly. ",
  },
  {
    num: "4",
    title: "What are the noteworthy concepts associated with Substrate blockchain development?",
    desc: "Substrate blockchain development is associated with three important concepts such as consensus, runtime, and extrinsic. Runtime is considered the most crucial part of the entire Substrate implementation, as it is used for making the projects work as they are supposed to. Moreover, the runtime describes the overall blockchain state and indicates the rules associated with it. ",
    li: "Consensus, on the other hand, is an engine provided by Substrate for determining the right time for state transitions to take place and conflicts to be resolved. Moreover, Substrate blocks also consist of a header or wide extrinsic, which are considered crucial to interact with the blockchains outside the state. "
  },
  {
    num: "5",
    title: "What are the specific coding languages that are preferred for developing Substrate blockchain solutions?",
    desc: "As stated in the article, Substrate blockchain development is approached primarily with the use of Rust coding language. It is the system-specific coding language that offers safety, concurrency, and speed. But at Comfygen, there is a scope for our developers to use other languages as well, such as AssemblyScript or C++, for curating only certain specific parts of the Substrate codebase that is being used for making the project."

    num: "8",
    title: "Is there any difference between Substrate pallets and smart contracts?",
    desc: "Yes, some of the potential differences between Substrate pallets and smart contracts are:",
    li: "Smart contracts are referred to by businesses and developers as self-executing agreements that are curated or written directly within the code. On the other hand, the Substrate pallets are referred to as the modular components within the dedicated blockchain framework, used for building the core functionalities of a custom blockchain. ",
    li1: "Smart contracts are mostly written in Solidity coding language, whereas Pallets are mostly written in Rust. "

    num: "9",
    title: " What is the right way to deploy the smart contract Substrate?",
    desc: "The steps that you must follow in order to deploy the smart contract substrate are as follows:",
    li: "Creation of the smart contract by using the Parity’s ink. Take the help of our experts in the process, as we are proficient with Rust coding language. ",
    li1: "Once the contract is created, you must then use your CLI to compile the code of your smart contract. ",
    li2: "Moving on, you must then configure the substrate chain.",
    li3: "And then, you can go ahead and deploy the contract. ",
    li4: "Now, all of these steps might seem a bit complex, for which you must take the help of reliable experts, just like Comfygen. With our team backing you with the Substrate blockchain development solutions, you don’t have to go deeper into the technicalities of these steps, as we shall assist you right from planning to deployment of your app. "
