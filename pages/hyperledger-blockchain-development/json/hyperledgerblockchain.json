      "desc": "You can achieve data privacy on Hyperledger by utilizing different methods, such as segregating the network into different channels or restricting data access privileges. In addition, you should also maintain privacy of data from other organizations operating on the channel. Furthermore, TLS can help in encryption of data in-transit while file system encryption could help in encrypting ledger data at rest. "

You can find two noticeable approaches for defining assets in majority of blockchain solutions. First of all, you have the UTXO model, which involves encoding account balances into historical transaction records. The other approach utilizes the account model, which involves storage of account balance on state storage space."
